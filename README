It's WidgetTown!  Everyone's favorite CS3505 project by John Wells and Joel Hough!

To build:
cd WidgetTown
qmake
make

To run:
./WidgetTown

Difference from ORIG:
We used ORIG's CustomProxy, but with a different animation.  Everything else was "inspired by" the demo.

Here are some tips:
- WASD to move
- If WASD isn't moving your character, click on his feet.  The key input goes to whichever widget you last clicked, so if you interact with a calendar, for example, it sees the WASDs until you click your player.
- Our widgets are in windows, which you can move around, resize, and close!  Careful though, close it and it'll be gone until you restart.
